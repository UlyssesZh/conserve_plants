\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The decrease in biodiversity due to the extinction of endangered plants and animals is a serious problem.
To avoid this, people need to spend money on protecting the plants and animals.

However, in some places like Florida, greatly needing biodiversity conservation,
people do not have enough money to protect all of the imperiled species there.
They need to find out a proper scheme of funding and protecting to make full use of the funds to get as much benefit as possible.

Different projects of conservation have different cost, benefit, and required time,
as shown in the table of threatened plants data (abbreviated as TPD in the following parts of the paper).
It is to be determined which projects are selected in the optimal plan according to these factors.
After choosing the projects, when to start the projects should also be determined to balance the funds spent over time as possible.
To make it clear what is going to be done, the problem is restated mathematically in Section \ref{sec:restatement}.
The model and the method to derive the results are to be explained in Section \ref{sec:model}.

We will write a non-technical memo in Section \ref{sec:memo} to give our proposal according to our model.

\section{Restatement of the problem}
\label{sec:restatement}

In Florida, many plant species are facing the challenge of extinction.
Various plant conservation project are now being conducted to resolve this problem.
However, the fund mainly from the annual fundraising is not sufficient to support all projects.
Therefore, it is essential to make a plan to precisely decide which project should be included.
The final goal of this plan is not to save as many as plant species as possible.
Instead, it should generate more benefit meanwhile taking account of different factors, like feasibility of success and the uniqueness of this species.
The time spanning to finish the whole plan is also a factor that should be seriously considered as more time being taken to protect one species, the likelihood of conserving another shall decrease, finally leading to less benefit.
The most suitable plan we need to find out should include all variables mentioned and give the best result.

\section{The model}
\label{sec:model}

\begin{comment}
\subsection{Relationship of different variable}
Suppose the funds raised each year is a constant $\alpha$, and the total fund raised $\sigma$ is given. Then $\sigma$ can be expressed in terms of $\alpha$:\\
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:total_fund}
	\sigma=\sum_{u=1}^I\alpha=I\alpha
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\alpha=\frac{\sigma}{I}
\label{eq:funds_raised_each_year}
\end{equation}
The total cost of a single project $x$ and $e_x$ can be expressed as:\\
\begin{equation}
e_x=\sum_{v=1}^{T_x}E_x^{v},(x\in{Q_i}\subset \mathbb Z)
\end{equation}
We also can get the total cost of the whole plan:\\
\begin{equation}
\mathbb E=\sum_x e_x,(x\in{Q_i}\subset \mathbb Z)
\end{equation}
From $(3)$, replace $e_x$ with $\sum\nolimits_{n=1}^NE_x^{v}$\\
\begin{equation}
\mathbb E = \sum_x{\sum_{v=1}^{T_x}E_x^{v}},(x\in{Q_i}\subset \mathbb Z)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Evaluation of various project}
The effective benefit of a certain project $x$, $\beta_x$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\beta_x={B_x}\cdot{U_x}\cdot{S_x}
\end{equation}

\par We use effective benefit $\beta_x$ instead of the benefit provided in the table of Threatened Plants Data (TPD) because benefit in the TPD ignores the fact that it relies on the uniqueness of the plant species and feasibility of success. If $U_x$ equals to $0$ (there are lots of other plant species can fill in its position), there is no need to preserve it as the benefit can completely brought by other plant species. Likewise, if $S_x$ equals to $0$ (no probability to succeed at all), even highest benefit remains useless. However, in terms of $\beta_x$ expression, it becomes 0 when $U_x$ or $S_x$ or both equal to 0, indicating no need for protecting this kind of plant.
\par As can be seen in the TPD, both $U_x$ and $S_x$  are in the interval $[0,1]$. When either or both of these variables get close to $1$ (high probability and uniqueness), the benefit $B_x$ of a certain project can be fully displayed:\\
\begin{equation}
\beta_x={B_x} \cdot {U_x} \cdot {S_x} \approx {B_x} \cdot 1 \cdot 1={B_x}
\end{equation}
\par Whether a plan is successful not only depends on how many species it saves or benefit it brings, but also relies on the expense and time spanning to finish it. Another variable $\zeta$ needs to be determined to further evaluate the plan. It can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\zeta=\frac{\sum_x ({B_x} \cdot {U_x} \cdot {S_x})}{\mathbb E \cdot I}(x\in{Q_i}\subset \mathbb Z)
\end{equation}
\par By using formula $(4)$, we can further expand it:
\begin{equation}
\zeta=\frac{\sum_x ({B_x} \cdot {U_x} \cdot {S_x})}{(\sum_x e_x) \cdot I}=\frac{\sum_x ({B_x} \cdot {U_x} \cdot {S_x})}{\sum_x {\sum_{v=1}^{T_x}E_x^{v}}\cdot I},(x\in{Q_i}\subset \mathbb Z)
\end{equation}
\par This equation is related to the time and the cost.
When the total cost or the time span is too large, the denominator $e_x \cdot T_x$ would decrease significantly, making $\zeta$ a small figure.
Lower number indicates less efficiency.
$\zeta$ of the optimal plans would be greater than those of other plans.

\subsection{Function and constraint}
\par In the first year, the total fund $F_1$ after fundraising is:
\begin{equation}
F_1=k+\alpha
\end{equation}
Suppose the all the projects that would be conducted in the first year $A_1$ is given, their total cost in the first year can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
C_1=\sum_{u_1}{E_{u_1}^1},(u_1 \in A_1)
\end{equation}

The total cost in the first year could not exceed the total fund raised. This constraint can be showed as:
\begin{equation}
F_1=k+\alpha > C_1 =\sum_{u_1}{E_{u_1}^1},(u_1 \in A_1)
\end{equation}

\par And the left fund $L_1$ is:
\begin{equation}
L_1=F_1-C_1=k+a-\sum_{u_1} E_{u_1}^1,(u_1 \in A_1)
\end{equation}
\par Second year’s fund is the combination of the fund left in the first year and the fund raised in the second year:
\begin{equation}
F_2=L_1+\alpha
\end{equation}
\par Suppose all projects initiated in the second year $A_2$ is also given, the total cost in the second year $C_2$ the combination of the cost of projects initiated in the first year and projects initiated in the second year:
\begin{equation}
C_2=\sum_{u_1} E_{u_1}^2+\sum_{u_2} E_{u_2}^1,(u_1\in A_1,u_2\in A_2)
\end{equation}
\par Also, the constraint is that the total fund in second year is greater than the total cost:
\begin{equation}
F_2=L_1+\alpha>C_2x```
\end{equation}
\par The fund left in the second year $L_2$ is:
\begin{equation}
L_2=F_2-C_2=L_1+\alpha-C_2=k+2\alpha-(\sum_{u_1} E_{u_1}^2+\sum_{u_2} E_{u_2}^1),(u_1\in A_1,u_2\in A_2)
\end{equation}
\par Based on the same principal, we can find the total cost of projects in $n^{th}$ year:
\begin{equation}
C_n=\sum_{u_1} E_{u_1}^{n}+\sum_{u_2} E_{u_2}^{n-1}+\cdots+\sum_{u_n} E_{u_n}^1=\sum_{i=1}^n {\sum_{u_i} E_{u_i}^{n-i+1}}
\end{equation}
$$(define \forall n-i+1>T_{u_i}:E_ui^{n-i+1}=0)$$
where $(u_p\in A_p,(p=1,2,\cdots,n))$.
And the total fund in $F_n$ can also be found:\\
\begin{equation}
	F_n=L_{n-1}+\alpha=F_{n-1}-C_{n-1}+\alpha=F_{n-1}-\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sum_{u_i} E_{u_i}^{(n-1)-i+1}+\alpha
\end{equation}

$$(u_p \in A_p,(p=1,2,\cdots,n-1))$$

Through this recursion formula, we can find $F_n$ in terms of $F_1$:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	F_n&=F_{n-2}-\sum_{i=1}^{n-2} \sum_{u_i} E_{u_i}^{(n-2)-i+1}-\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{u_i} E_{u_i}^{(n-1)-i+1}+\alpha+\alpha=F_{n-3}-\cdots+3\alpha\\
	&=F_1-\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{j}\sum_{u_i} E_{u_i}^{j-i+1}+(n-1)\alpha=k+\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} {\sum_{i=1}^{j} \sum_{u_i} E_{u_i}^{j-i+1}+n\alpha},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $u_p \in A_p$, and $p=1,2,\cdots,n-1)$.

Therefore, by using $(1)$, we can get a series of constraints:

$$F_P>C_p,(p=1,2,\cdots,n)$$
\begin{equation}
k+\sum_{j=1}^{p-1} {\sum_{i=1}^j}{\sum_{u_i}}E_{u_i}^{p-i+1}+p\alpha>\sum_{i=1}^p {\sum_{u_i} E_{u_i}^{p-i+1}},(p=1,2,\cdots,n)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
k+\sum_{j=1}^{p-1} {\sum_{i=1}^j}{\sum_{u_i}}E_{u_i}^{p-i+1}+p\frac{\sigma}{I}>\sum_{i=1}^p {\sum_{u_i} E_{u_i}^{p-i+1}},(p=1,2,\cdots,n)
\end{equation}

\par Under these constraints, in order to give the best plan for plant conservation, we need to find the greatest value of $\zeta$ $(9)$:
\begin{equation}
	\zeta = \frac{\sum_x (B_x \cdot U_x \cdot _{S_x})}{(\sum_x \sum_{v=1}^{T_x})\cdot I},(x \in {Q_i} \subset Z=\bigcup\limits_{t=1}^{n} A_t)
\end{equation}
\end{comment}

\subsection{Raw attributes of projects}

The word \textbf{project} is used to represent a conservation of a certain species of plant.
In this article, the symbol $x$ is used to number and denote a project.
Note that in this article, all numberings
(like $x$ here numbering the projects, and $n$ later numbering the years)
start with $0$ instead of $1$ to meet the convention in computer science.

According to the TPD, there are some \textbf{raw datas} attributed to a project $x$, which are
the \textbf{unique id}, the \textbf{taxonomic uniqueness} $u_x$, the \textbf{feasibility of success} $s_x$, the \textbf{cost} $c_{x,n}$ of the $n$th year.

To make the concepts more clear and make it easy to use them later,
although the meanings of the raw datas are described in the TPD,
their meanings should be re-described in a mathematical way.

\begin{definition}[benefit]
The \textbf{benefit} of a project is a real number $b_x\in\left[0,+\infty\right)$.
\end{definition}

The benefit is an important indicator indicating how imperiled the species is and how easy the project can be done.
However, $b_x$ cannot be directly used to measure how much can we benefit from finishing the project.
Another derived concept called \textbf{effective benefit} should be used instead, as explained in Section \ref{sec:effective benefit}.

\begin{definition}[taxonomic uniqueness]
The \textbf{taxonomic uniqueness} of a project is a real number $u_x\in\left[0,1\right]$.
\end{definition}

The taxonomic uniqueness is a measure of how the species is unique from other species.
It is stipulated that $u_x=0$ if there exists a species that is exactly the same as the species conserved in project $x$,
and $u_x=1$ if the species conserved in project $x$ does not have any similarities with any other species.

\begin{definition}[feasibility of success]
The \textbf{feasibility of success} of a project is a real number $s_x\in\left[0,1\right]$.
\end{definition}

The feasibility of success is the probability of the success of the project.

\subsection{Constraints to the plan}

The word \textbf{plan} is used to represent how the projects are going to be executed,
including which projects are executed and when should they start.

\subsection{Effective benefit}
\label{sec:effective benefit}

Although $b_x$ is defined for a project, hardly can a project lead to so much benefit finally.
A new concept should be defined to describe how much can people actually benefit from finishing the project.

\begin{definition}
The \textbf{effective benefit} of a project is a real number $\beta_x\in\left[0,+\infty\right)$ defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:effective benefit}
\beta_x:=b_xu_xs_x.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

Here is the explanation of why the effective benefit should be defined as Equation \ref{eq:effective benefit}.

First, consider the effect of $u_x$.
If $u_x=0$, which means there is a species the same as the conserved species,
the conservation is useless because even if the conserved species die out, there are other species taking the place.
If $u_x=1$, which means there are no similar species to the conserved species,
the conservation is meaningful and can exert full benefit.
From these two cases, it is reasonable to multiply $b_x$ with $u_x$,
which means $u_x$ represents the portion of $b_x$ that can be exerted if the project is successfully finished.

Then, consider the effect of $s_x$.
It is a probability, so the effect should be considered statistically.
Imagine there are many parallel universes, in each of which project $x$ is carried out under the same condition.
According to the law of large numbers, the portion of successful executions is the probability $s_x$, exerting the benefit,
while the rest does not make any benefit.
Then, the mean of all the benefits is $s_x\cdot b_x+\left(1-s_x\right)\cdot0=b_xs_x$.

Combining the two effects above, the formula for effective benefit (Equation \ref{eq:effective benefit}) can be derived.

From now on, when measuring how much can a project benefit people,
$\beta_x$ is used instead of $b_x$.
